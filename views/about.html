    <h1>About</h1>
    <h1>Mika Waltari</h1>

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>
      Waltari was born in Helsinki on 19 September 1908.[3] His parents were
      Toimi Waltari and Olga Johansson; Toimi was a Lutheran pastor once,
      teaching religion in Porvoo, and Olga one of his pupils. A scandal caused
      by their relationship had forced them to move to Tampere and the two
      married each other on 18 November 1906.[4] At the age of five Mika Waltari
      suddenly lost his father to illness on 5 July 1914, and the 25-year old
      Olga Waltari was left, with crucial help from Toimi's brother Toivo, to
      support her three children: Samuli (7 years), Mika (5 years) and Erkki (6
      months).[5] As a boy, he witnessed the Finnish Civil War, during which his
      White-sided family fled to the home of his mother's aunt at Laukkoski in
      Pornainen, near Porvoo, which was relatively peaceful and where the Whites
      were predominant.[6] Later he enrolled in the University of Helsinki as a
      theology student, according to his uncle Toivo's[7] wishes, but soon
      abandoned theology in favour of philosophy, aesthetics and literature,
      graduating in 1929.[1] While studying, he contributed to various magazines
      and wrote poetry and stories, getting his first book Jumalaa paossa
      published in 1925 - it was a success, selling 3000 copies despite being
      only 72 pages long.[7] In 1927 he went to Paris where he wrote his first
      major novel Suuri illusioni ('The Grand Illusion'), a story of bohemian
      life.[1] In terms of style, the novel is considered to be the Finnish
      equivalent to the works of the American writers of the Lost Generation.
      (In Waltari's historical novel The Adventurer, taking place in the 16th
      century, the protagonist is a Finn who goes to study in Paris at much the
      same age that the author went to the same city in the 20th century). Suuri
      Illusioni was a surprise hit, selling 8000 copies and turning Mika Waltari
      into a famous author.[8] Waltari also was, for a while, a member of the
      liberal literary movement Tulenkantajat,[9] though his political and
      social views later turned conservative. He was married on 8 March 1931 to
      Marjatta Luukkonen, whom he had met during military service the preceding
      year, and on 4 January 1932 they had a daughter, Satu.[10] Satu also
      became a writer. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Waltari worked as a
      journalist and critic, writing for a number of newspapers and magazines
      and travelling widely in Europe. He directed the magazine Suomen
      Kuvalehti.[11] At the same time, he kept writing books in many genres,
      moving easily from one literary field to another. He had a very busy
      schedule and strict work ethic. He also suffered from manic-depressive
      psychosis and became depressed after completion of a book, sometimes to
      the extent of needing hospital treatment; in his manic phases he did his
      writing.[12] He participated, and often succeeded, in literary
      competitions to prove the quality of his work to critics. One of these
      competitions gave rise to one of his most popular characters, Inspector
      Palmu, a gruff detective of the Helsinki police department, who starred in
      three mystery novels, all of which were filmed (a fourth film was made
      without Waltari involved). Waltari also scripted the popular cartoon Kieku
      ja Kaiku and wrote Aiotko kirjailijaksi, a guidebook for aspiring writers
      that influenced many younger writers such as Kalle Päätalo.[1]

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>
      During the Winter War (1939–1940) and the Continuation War (1941–1944),
      Waltari worked in the government information center, now also placing his
      literary skills at the service of political propaganda. According to
      historian Eino Jutikkala, through this experience as a propagandist
      Waltari became more cynical as he realised the prevalence of historical
      half-truths shaped by propaganda - later a recurrent theme in his
      historical novels. Although Waltari saw USSR Communism as dangerous, he
      was attracted to the National Socialist theories about a new man - he
      visited Germany in 1939, and wrote a mostly favourable article titled
      Tuntematon Saksa ('Unknown Germany'). In 1942 he and 6 other Finnish
      writers visited Germany to attend the Congress of the European Writers'
      Union in Weimar, and wrote yet more favourable coverage; a story goes
      however that he, being slightly drunk, refused the pocket money brought by
      their "patient and attentive German hosts" to their hotel by tearing it in
      half and throwing it away through the window.[13] 1945 saw the publication
      of Waltari's first and most successful historical novel, The Egyptian. Its
      theme of the corruption of humanist values in a materialist world seemed
      curiously topical in the aftermath of World War II, and the book became an
      international bestseller, serving as the basis of the 1954 Hollywood movie
      of the same name. Waltari wrote seven more historical novels, placed in
      various ancient cultures, among others The Dark Angel, set during the Fall
      of Constantinople in 1453. In these novels, he gave powerful expression to
      his fundamental pessimism and also, in two novels set in the Roman Empire,
      to his Christian conviction. After the war, he also wrote several
      novellas. He became a member of the Finnish Academy in 1957 and received
      an honorary doctorate at the University of Turku in 1970.[14]

    <h2>Later years</h2>
    <p>
      Waltari's last two novels tell about early history of Christianity:
      Valtakunnan salaisuus (English title: The Secret of the Kingdom 1959), and
      Ihmiskunnan viholliset (English title: The Roman 1964). As a member of
      Academy of Science and Letters he guided younger writers. He was also
      involved in re-publishing and editing his early works, and gave long
      interviews to Ritva Haavikko which were published as a book.[14][15]
      Waltari was one of the most prolific Finnish writers. He wrote at least 29
      novels, 15 novellas, 6 collections of stories or fairy-tales, 6
      collections of poetry and 26 plays, as well as screen plays, radio plays,
      non-fiction, translations, and hundreds of reviews and articles. He is
      also internationally the best-known Finnish writer, and his works have
      been translated into more than 30 languages.[1] In his later years,
      Waltari wrote less and less. This is partly due to the enormous fees he
      received from foreign editions of The Egyptian and his other books,
      allowing him to stop "writing to live".[16] Mika Waltari died on 26 August
      1979 in Helsinki, the year after his wife Marjatta's death in 1978.[17]
